          <h1>Welcome</h1>
          <p class="h1">Welcome [user], thanks for taking the time to view my website. Here you will find a bunch of information about me, my previous work both in web development and job experience. This website will serve as an online resume.</p>
          <h2>About Me</h2>
          <p class="h2">I've worked a lot of jobs since I turned 16. I have worked in the tech industry, medical healthcare industry, music production industry, and food industry. Thats not even half of it! Safe to say I refer to myself as someone who can achieve anything if I put my mind to it.</p>
          <h3>Medical Career</h3>
          <p class="h3">In my work as an Emergency Medical Technician, I've learned that not only does it take patience, but discipline as well. My exstensive inner workings with a military style command structure, make me someone who knows when to follow and when to lead. Being such a "liable" area of work, extensive, detailed, and concise reports had to be made multiple times daily for each and every patient.</p>
